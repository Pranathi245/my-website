Geography and climate

A view of Eastern Ghats from Borra Caves railway station
The caves are located in the Araku Valley of the Ananthagiri hill range and is drained by the Gosthani River. At the entry, the cave measures up to 100 m (330 ft) horizontally and 75 m (246 ft) vertically. Stalagmite and stalactite formations are found in the caves.[6]

The average annual temperature of Araku hills, where the caves are situated, is about 25 °C (77 °F). The average annual rainfall reported is 950 mm (3.12 ft) (mostly occurring during the northeast monsoon).[7] The Gosthani river provides water supply to the Visakhapatnam city.[4]

Geology
The regional geology in the Eastern Ghats mobile belt, where the caves are located, is represented by the khondalite suite of rocks (garnetiferrous sillimanite gneisses, quartzo-feldsphatic garnet gneisses) of Archaen age. Quaternary deposits consist of red bed sediments, laterites, pediment fans, colluvium, alluvium and coastal sands.[1] The caves in the reserved forest area basically host a variety of speleothems of various sizes and irregularly shaped stalactites and stalagmites. The carbonate rocks are pure white, and coarsely crystalline and the deformed and banded marbles cover a triangular area of two km2 (0.77 sq mi); surrounded by diopside–scapolite–feldspar calc-granulites. The pyroxenite outcrops are dark and massive and include discontinuous calc-silicate bands, some of brown mica and others with calcite.[7]
